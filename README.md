# HR-System || ASP.NET Core MVC
Developed using ASP.NET Core MVC, used for managing various HR-related tasks. The system effectively
records attendance, monitors employee follow-ups, and facilitates dismissals. Additionally, it seamlessly manages salary details, deductions, and financial additions for employees.
I utilized technologies such as .NET Core MVC, Bootstrap, jQuery, and SQL, ensuring a user-friendly interface. The result is an intuitive and efficient HR solution that streamlines processes, enhances productivity, and improves overall organizational management.
